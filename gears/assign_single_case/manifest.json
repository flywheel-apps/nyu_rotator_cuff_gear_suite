    "description": "This gear assigns a single case to a specified readers from a master project given constraints. Each case is assessed by a \"case_coverage\" number of readers. If the case is being assigned to an additional reader, the \"case_coverage\" is incremented. Each reader elects to have a maximum number of cases (\"max_cases\") to assess. If this gear attempts to assign more than \"max_cases\", the gear fails with message.",
